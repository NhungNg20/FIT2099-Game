GroundSmashAction

Action associated with a player movement onto a high ground object while under the influence of a power star. This action is an allowable action of the ground class iff:
1. CanActorEnter(actor)returns true. (useful to set out of bounds)
2. Ground object has attribute elevated = true
3. Actor has Capability Status.Godzilla (Set by ConsumeStarAction)

To use, the Ground class allowableActions method must be overridden to return MoveActorAction,GroundSmashAction, or empty ActionList based on the above.
GroundSmashAction has the same instance variables as  MoveActorAction, namely destination location, direction and hotkey.

When GroundSmashAction.execute(actor, map) is called, the destination location is first modified to contain Dirt ground and containing Coin item. This is acheived by calling the location’s setGround and addItem methods. A MoveActorAction object is then instantiated and it’s execute method called. The execute method will follow the pseudocode:

GroundSmashAction.execute(actor,map)
	toLocation.setGround(new Dirt())
	toLocation.addItem(new Coin(5) )
	moveAction = new MoveActorAction( toLocation, direction)
	moveAction.execute(actor,map)
	return
