TradeAction(Actor player, Item item, int value)
A trade action subtracts the value of the traded item from the actor’s wallet and  ads the item to the inventory. 
TradeAction is an allowable action of Toad and an ActionList of trade actions is returned by calling toad’s allowableActions method while Player is neighbouring.

The TradeAction execution will conform to the following pseudocode:

TradeAction.execute(actor,map)
	wallet = actor.getWallet()
	if (value > wallet.getBalence() )
		return message "You don't have enough coins!"
	wallet.deduct(value)
	player.addToInventory(item)
	return message “[actor] sells [item] to [player] for $[value]”


[PickUpCoinAction(Actor player,Coin) 14/04 Does not work! regular PickUpItemAction must be used and Player modified to make wallet updates when addToInventory called!]
[Similar to PickUpItemAction, except the coin is not placed into an actor's inventory. Instead the balance (int) in a Player’s Wallet is increased. Wallet is a separate Class used by Player. This allows Open-Close]
