SuperMushroom and PowerStar implement the Consumable interface. 
The consumable interface has two methods,   consume(Actor actor) and resetEffect(Actor actor).
Consume() is called with  an actor as argument, and is responsible for setting all of the effects of a magical item. resetEffect(Actor actor) is responsible for undoing what consume changed.
This interface allows for an item to effect on an actor and then to return to the normal state.
